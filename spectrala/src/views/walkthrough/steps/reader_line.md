<details><summary>Function of the line </summary>
Spectrala works by measuring the brightness of each pixel across a reader line at specific, consistent positions across the line. The line has to be in a proper orientation to differentiate between the lower-energy side of the spectrum and the higher-energy part of the spectrum. <br/><br/><i>This line should not be moved in future steps,</i> so be sure to keep the spectrometer steady throughout the process of collecting measurements.

</details>
<details><summary>How to place the line </summary>
If you have multiple spectra showing, choose the one that is most distinct and moderately saturated. Move the red dot just past the red (lower-energy) side of the spectrum and the blue dot just past the blue (higher-energy) side of the spectrum.

<details><summary>Example placement</summary>
This reader line was placed on a spectrum formed by a CFL bulb (although a CFL bulb is not necessary for this process).
