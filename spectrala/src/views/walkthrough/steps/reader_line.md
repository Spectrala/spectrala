Spectrala works by measuring the brightness of each pixel across a reader line at specific, consistent positions across the line. The line has to be in a proper orientation to differentiate between the lower-energy side of the spectrum and the higher-energy part of the spectrum. 

The purpose of this step is to place this line. *This line should not be moved in future steps,* so be sure to keep the spectrometer steady throughout the process of collecting measurements.

If you have multiple spectra showing, choose the one that is most distinct and moderately saturated. Move the red dot just past the red (lower-energy) side of the spectrum and the blue dot just past the blue (higher-energy) side of the spectrum.
