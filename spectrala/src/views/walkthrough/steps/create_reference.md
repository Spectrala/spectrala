The "Spectrum" chart is a live view of the spectrum inside the spectrometer. First, give your spectrometer a baseline (or reference spectrum) by using plain water inside a cuvette.
1. Place a cuvette filled with uncontaminated water into the spectrometer and select the "Capture" button. This will save a map of intensity to wavelength and insert it into the "Saved spectra" menu.
2. Rename the spectrum from "New spectrum" to something meaningful (like "water").
3. Identify the sample as a reference spectrum by clicking the dropdown to the right of the recorded spectrum in the "Saved spectra" menu and selecting "Use as reference."

This will allow for the calculation of transmittance and absorbance for future spectra according to Beer's law.
