Pick a light source or multiple light sources that will create peaks at known wavelengths in the spectrum. At least two of these points are required for calibration.

Use the dropdown on the top right of the select points menu to choose between presets of collections of known wavelengths. 

If necessary, these can be edited by changing the text in the boxes. Remove points with the X on the right, and add points with the plus button to the left of the dropdown.
