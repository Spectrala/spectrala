Examples of good Spectra
<details><summary>With CFL Bulb </summary>
<p>This is not expected to be a continous spectrum due to the mercury vapor inside the bulb. Note that of the two spectra in the image, the higher one is more distinct and has better saturation quality than the lower one.

<details><summary>With white LED</summary>
<p>
A white LED is expected to result in a continous spectrum. Note that of the two spectra in the image, the higher one is more distinct and has better saturation quality than the lower one.

Points of caution
<details><summary>Expected pattern </summary>
<p>Incandescent bulbs or white LEDs should produce a continous stream of colors, while CFL bulbs or colored LEDs have distinct areas of higher intensities and lower intensities. If a distinct spectrum is expected and is not appearing, there may be too much light going into the spectrometer.
</p>

<details><summary>Oversaturation </summary>
<p>This is an example of an oversaturated spectrum. Note how some of the colors turn to white.

<details><summary>Undersaturation</summary>
<p>
This is an example of an undersaturated spectrum, as the colors are hard to see.

Troubleshooting tips
<details><summary>Slit size </summary>
<p>Slits should ideally be very thin (1mm), formed by two edges that are as straight as possible. An opening too large could create oversaturation or a blending of colors when a spectrum with distinct lines is expected, and an opening too small could cause undersaturation.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Slit to light source distance </summary>
<p>The ideal distance between the light source and the spectrometer could be a matter of a few centimeters or a couple meters. Testing out different distances and angles can affect the clarity of the spectrum.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Slit to camera distance </summary>
<p>Try placing the camera as close to the slit as possible, then gradually moving it backward. If your spectrometer is a shoebox, it is likely that you won't need the entire length of the shoebox to separate your camera from the slit.
