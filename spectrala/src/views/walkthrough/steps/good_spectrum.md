Ensure you have a good view of the spectrum. You may have to adjust the size of the slit, the distance between the slit and the camera, or the location of the light source. 

A 'good' spectrum has the following qualities:
 - Is saturated enough to see colors but not too saturated to the point where colors turn to white.
 - Follows expected patterns given light sources. Incandescent bulbs or white LEDs should produce a continous stream of colors, while CFL bulbs or colord LEDs have distinct areas of higher intensities and lower intensities.  

This is a 'good' spectrum using a CFL bulb. This is not expected to be a continous spectrum. Note that there are two spectra shown, of which the higher one is more distinct and has better saturation quality than the lower one.

This is a 'good' spectrum using a white LED. This is expected to be a continous spectrum. The upper spectrum also has better saturation quality in this example.

This is an example of an oversaturated spectrum. Note how the colors turn to white.

This is an example of an undersaturated spectrum. Note how the colors are hard to see.
