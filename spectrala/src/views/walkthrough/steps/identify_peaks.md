Procedure
1. Use the "Place" button to the left of each of the points you configured in the previous section. This will select a wavelength to be identified.
2. Click the location on the graph with the highest intensity corresponding to the selected wavelength. Wavelengths must be placed in ascending order. 
3. If necessary, edit points that have been placed using the pencil button on the right.

Using a CFL bulb will create multiple peaks at the same time which can all be identified at once, while flashing a single colored LED should only create a single peak. If using LEDs, it is an option to flash them one at a time and individually identify the peak intensity for each wavelength.

<details><summary>What does this step do? </summary>
The "Calibration" graph represents pixel intensities across the reader line. The purpose of calibration is to assign a meaningful x-axis to this graph, which will be wavelength (in nanometers). Without this step, intensities could only be mapped to their location on the line (from 0% to 100%). </details>
