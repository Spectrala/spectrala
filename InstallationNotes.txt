Notes on running the software

If an aspiring scientist or an enthusiast creates a spectrometer, their best bets for software to work with it are Spectral Workbench (spectralworkbench.org) or Theremino Spectrometer (https://www.theremino.com/en/downloads/automation). Neither application is very intuitive, and Theremino Spectrometer is Windows-only. 

Caltech students are developing a new application called Spectrala which aims to be more intuitive and have more utility than existing applications.

To install the software, download the attached zip file corresponding to your system. 

If running the software on Mac, note that you'll have to go into System Preferences > Security & Privacy and click the lock on the bottom left to select "Open anyway" in order for the app to load. 

On Windows, you may get a dialogue box "Windows protected your PC." To get through this, select "More info" then "Run anyway." 

Being a work in progress, this software is not guaranteed to work perfectly. Feedback is much appreciated. To give feedback, please email spectrala.feedback@gmail.com.
